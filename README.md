# Projet "Try to Click"
This project is a fun web application where users have to try to click on the mobile button as soon as it appears.
However, the button moves every time the mouse gets close to it, making the game more difficult *(or even impossible)*.

**Disclaimer**: This *fun* project was created for launching on the web and is not intended to be used on mobile devices.

## Features

- The button moves **randomly** when the mouse gets close to it.
- **Every time**.
- The button is **always** moving.
<br>
- If you manage to click on the button, a *surprise* awaits you!
